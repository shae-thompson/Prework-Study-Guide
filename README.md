# Prework Study Guide

## Description
This is a guide to use to study the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The purpose of this guide was to create ahub for information that was easily accessable, readable and alos a learning experience in and of itself. This guide allows for information of numerous topics to be centrally located in a way that is easy to revise and refer to, rather than the use of handwritten note tkaing which can be aethetically unappealing, messy and unoganised. Through makiing this guide I have leant a lot, prior to this project, I didn't even know what termimal was or that it was even on my computer. Throughout this project, I have learnt that with time and patience I can do whatever I set my mind to. I have also learnt many new things about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I have also learnt I really like playing with the colours in CSS.
